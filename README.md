# MiniProjcet
Intelligent Vehicle Damage Assessment and Cost Estimator for Insurance Companies 

Prerequisites:

To complete this project, required software,concepts and packages are as follows

Anaconda Navigator:https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution
Anaconda Navigator is free and open-source distribution of the Python and R programming machine learning-related applications. It can be install based on your running OS it is an open-Source, cross-platform,package mangement system.Anaconda comes with so many tools like JupyterLab,Jupter Notebook,Spyder.

To build Machine learning models you must require the following packages

>Numpy:
Numpy is a free machine learning library for Python. It features various algorithms like support    vector machines, random forests, and k- neighbors, and it also supprts Python numerical and scientifec libraries like Numpy and SciPy

>Flask:
Flask is Web framework used for building Web applications through Python . Here build in Server and fast debugger is availble it is the advantage of using flask.

>> Neccessary Python packages for project:
  >>Open anaconda prompt as administrator and install required libraries
  >>Type "pip install numpy" as click enter.
  >>Type "pip install pandas" and click enter.
  >>Type "pip install scickit-learn" and click enter.
  >>Type "pip install tensorflow==2.3.2" and click enter.
  >>Type "pip install Keras==2.3.1" and click enter.
  >>Type "pip install Flask" and click enter.
  
>>pandas:
Pandas is an open source Python package that is most widely used for data science/data analysis and machine learning tasks. It is built on top of another package named Numpy, which provides support for multi-dimensional arrays.

>>Scikit-learn is an open source data analysis library, and the gold standard for Machine Learning (ML) in the Python ecosystem. Key concepts and features include: Algorithmic decision-making methods, including: Classification: identifying and categorizing data based on patterns

>>TensorFlow is an open-source library developed by Google primarily for deep learning applications. It also supports traditional machine learning. TensorFlow was originally developed for large numerical computations without keeping deep learning in mind.

>>keras:Keras is used for creating deep models which can be productized on smartphones. Keras is also used for distributed training of deep learning models. Keras is used by companies such as Netflix, Yelp, Uber, etc

>>

My project is about predition of outcome with the input of images so it means it is Deep Learning Cooncepts

here I used VGG16: VGG16 is transfer learning method. A pre-trained model trained on 1000 classes of different images, based on that it will predict the output.

Why I taken the VGG16 why don't Alexnet which similar like VGG16
>>Because it is little bit Complex then VGG16 it is hard to understand
>>Alexnet have less number of layers then compare ot VGG16
>>where VGG16 is part of CNN algorithm it is a prity good algorithm for deeplearning image classification




>>>Project Objective and Flow

     >Know fundamental concepts and techniques of VGG16.

     >Gain a broad understanding of image data.

     >Know how to pre-process/clean the data using different data preprocessing techniques.

     >Know how to build a web application using the Flask framework.


>>Project Flow:

     The user interacts with the UI (User Interface) to choose the image.

     The chosen image is analyzed by the model which is integrated with the flask application.

     VGG16  Model analyzes the image, then the prediction is showcased on the Flask UI.

     To accomplish this, I have collected all the data set and installed required libraries
     

>>Data Collection: For Data collection I used website called Kaggle it was a famous website for machine learning related works

  Create Train and Test Folders.

>Image Preprocessing. 

>Model Building

>Cloudant DB

>Application Building

>Building HTML Pages

>Build Python Code

>Run The Application
